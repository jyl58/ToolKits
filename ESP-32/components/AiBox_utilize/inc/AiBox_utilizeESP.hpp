/**
 * @brief   Function to print the CPU usage of tasks over a given duration.
 *
 * This function will measure and print the CPU usage of tasks over a specified
 * number of ticks (i.e. real time stats). This is implemented by simply calling
 * uxTaskGetSystemState() twice separated by a delay, then calculating the
 * differences of task run times before and after the delay.
 *
 * @note    If any tasks are added or removed during the delay, the stats of
 *          those tasks will not be printed.
 * @note    This function should be called from a high priority task to minimize
 *          inaccuracies with delays.
 * @note    When running in dual core mode, each core will correspond to 50% of
 *          the run time.
 *
 * @param   xTicksToWait    Period of stats measurement
 *
 * @return
 *  - ESP_OK                Success
 *  - ESP_ERR_NO_MEM        Insufficient memory to allocated internal arrays
 *  - ESP_ERR_INVALID_SIZE  Insufficient array size for uxTaskGetSystemState. Trying increasing ARRAY_SIZE_OFFSET
 *  - ESP_ERR_INVALID_STATE Delay duration too short
